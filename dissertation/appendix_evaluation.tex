\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/eval_chart_styles_math.png}
	\caption{Style preferences for mathematical surfaces. Bars represent the sum of votes across all presented images. Weighted average is computed with a weight of 3 applied to 1st choices, 2 applied to 2nd choices and 1 applied to 3rd choices. Results show strong preference for the streamline style, followed by roughly equal preference for Blender and stipple styles.}\label{eval_chart_styles_math}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/eval_chart_styles_other.png}
	\caption{As Figure \ref{eval_chart_styles_math}, but with consideration to non-mathematical surfaces. Results show moderate preference for Blender style, followed by roughly equivalent preferences for implemented NPR styles.}\label{eval_chart_styles_other}
