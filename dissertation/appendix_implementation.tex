\section{Streamlines}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{images/stream_cont1.png}
	\caption{The surface displayed is an intensity map extracted from Blender's UV pass. This particular image represents the U-coordinate intensities. Streamlines are displayed in colour - these are isolines which follow a given intensity of the underlying surface, creating an effective way to show surface structure. Each isoline is an indivual \texttt{Path}. This process is repeated with a range of different intensities in U and V coordinate space, to produce \texttt{Path}s which criss-cross the surface.}\label{stream_cont1}

	\caption{Stipple placement locations computed by a third party library based on varibale density Voroni cells, using the image intensity map (and some further User-provided factors) as the density function. Stipple locations here are plotted, each dot represents the ``head'' location for each stipple.}\label{stipple_placement}
