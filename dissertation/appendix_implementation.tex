\section{Streamlines}\label{impl_stream}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{images/stream_cont1.png}
	\caption{The surface displayed is an intensity map extracted from Blender's UV pass. This particular image represents the U-coordinate intensities. Streamlines are displayed in colour - these are isolines which follow a given intensity of the underlying surface, creating an effective way to show surface structure. Each isoline is an individual \texttt{Path}. This process is repeated with a range of different intensities in U and V coordinate space, to produce \texttt{Path}s which criss-cross the surface.}\label{stream_cont1}

Red dashed lines represent construction curves, from which the black outlines are derived through curve offsetting. Grey control points allow the length of each black outline path allow the stroke thickness to varied over its length (a slight taper is shown here on the leftmost stroke).}\label{stroke_construction}
